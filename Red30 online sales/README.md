# Red30 online sales

The dashboard shows the results of Red30 online sales. The idea with this dashboard is to understand how the online sales trend is going (line chart), and how are those sales structured by type of client (donut chart), product category (treemap) and state (map). The most interesting point, is that the charts change according to a specific measure, so you can see the charts by total revenue, quantity sold, number of orders or number of clients. One interesting finding is that although only 15% the customers are businesses, they generate 95% of the total revenue.
