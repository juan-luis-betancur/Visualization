# Visualization project for a Gift

For a birthday present to a beerlover I gave a Fizzics Draft Machine and beers from around the world. I created a Tableau dashbaord to explain a little bit about the beers
and how to use the draft machine. The interactive visualization was optimized for the iphone 11.

Here is the link for the dashboard! https://public.tableau.com/views/Cervezas/PasosRegalo?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
