# World's Most Valuable Sport Teams By Forbes

Every year Forbes releases a anual report on the World's Most Valuable Sport Teams. I wanted to create a visualization that helped navigate trough the reports (2010-2021)
in an interactive way to find interesting trends.

- NBA is climbing! In 2010 there were no NBA teams in the TOP 10, in 2021 3 teams were present.
- American Football is the king, in 2021 more than half of the most valuable 50 sport teams were from this league.
- Only teams from 7 countries were present in the reports.
